# More Flags

This Anki add-on adds the ability to add more card flags. You can add flags and customize their labels, colors and shortcuts from the config window under _Tools > Add-ons > Config_.

The add-on should work on Anki 2.1.46+.

The custom flags should behave like standard ones for the most part, but there are some issues to be aware of:

-   Searching for custom flags is only supported on 2.1.64+.
-   The "No Flag" sidebar item only understands custom flags on Anki 23.10+.
-   When you delete a custom flag from the config, it's not removed from the cards. So if you later add a new flag in place of the old one the cards will automatically reflect the new flag. This might change in the future.
-   Custom flags only work on the computer version.
