# More Flags

This Anki add-on adds the ability to add more card flags. You can add flags and customize their labels, colors and shortcuts from the config under _Tools > Add-ons_.

The add-on should work on Anki 2.1.46+.

The custom flags should behave like standard ones for the most part, but there are some issues to be aware of:

-   Searching for custom flags is only supported on 2.1.64+.
-   The "No Flag" sidebar item doesn't understand custom flags, so cards flagged with custom flags will show up in search here. This might be fixed in a future version.
-   Custom flags only work on the computer version.

## Download

You can download the add-on from AnkiWeb: [146757953](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/146757953)
